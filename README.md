# PROJET-GPU

The primary objective of this project was to take a C script or to code one in C and then recode it for a GPU to compare the CPU and GPU performance in terms of execution time. To achieve this goal, I implemented the QuickSort algorithm on the CPU and subsequently recoded it for the GPU. I focused on optimizing the GPU code to enhance its efficiency.
